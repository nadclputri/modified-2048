# Goal of the game
It takes place on a 5x5 board of squares on which a sequence of tiles appears, each holding a number. Players move tiles around by sliding rows and columns, with the aim of combining identical tiles to make higher numbers. The player's score is determined largely by the tiles on the final board.

# Rules
The game is played on a 5x grid of squares. Each square is either empty, or it holds a tile holding a number in {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ...}, i.e. a power of two. At the start of the game the board holds between one and twenty five 2-tiles.
